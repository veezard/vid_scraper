Namely, how many images are required in order to resolve heterogeneous structures as a function of the volume size and the signal to noise ratio?

While we prove that the resulting estimator for the covariance matrix is consistent in the classical limit as the number of projection images grow indefinitely, an interesting open question regarding the sample complexity of the problem remains. Namely, how many images are required in order to resolve heterogeneous structures as a function of the volume size and the signal to noise ratio? We will see that solving this question requires us to extend the analysis of principal component analysis (PCA) in high dimensions, as we encounter limiting distributions that differ from the classical Marcenko-Pastur distribution.$/;"	f
