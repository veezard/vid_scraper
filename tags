and	talks_ias.p	/^While methods for training EBMs at scale have improved drastically, they still lag behind other classes of generative models such as flows and GANs. Further, there has been little work on evaluating unnormalized models and comparing them with other model classes. My next work addresses these issues with the Stein Discrepancy (SD). The SD is a measure of distance between two distributions that is defined using samples from one distribution and an unnormalized model for the other. I explore how the stein discrepancy can be estimated in practice at scale and demonstrate applications related to goodness-of-fit testing and unnormalized model evaluation. Next, I show how my approach for SD estimation can be turned into a GAN-like training objective for EBMs which scales to high-dimensional data more gracefully than previous approaches.”Œworkshop”Nub.€•P/;"	f

field	talks_ias.p	/^In the 1740s, Japanese Confucians discovered a long lost sub-commentary of Confucius's Analects. After publication in 1750, an imprint was also sent to China, where it had disappeared circa 1200â€“1250. The commentary provided important information about medieval Chinese classical learning. Its preface recommended a medieval approach to the study of texts, which was surprisingly compatible with the contemporary research movement known as â€œevidential studiesâ€ in both China and Japan. In this talk, Elman will discuss whether this precocious philological insight was more than just adventitious. This lecture is made possible by the Dr. S.T.

led	talks_ias.p	/^However, our computational hardness argument currently depends on two unproved conjectures, both concerning the permanent of an n-by-n matrix X of independent N(0,1) complex Gaussians. The first conjecture says that that Pr[ |Per(X)| < sqrt(n!)\/poly(n) ] is upper-bounded by 1\/poly(n) , while the second conjecture says that approximating Per(X) , for most Gaussian matrices X , is a #P-complete problem. Both conjectures seem interesting even independently of our application. In this talk, I'll tell you about these conjectures, and the progress we were able to make toward proving them. Specifically, I'll show that our conjectured anti-concentration bound holds with the determinant in place of the permanent. If time permits, I'll also show that a weaker anti-concentration bound holds for the permanent; that *exactly* computing Per(X) with high probability for a Gaussian matrix X is #P-hard; and that extending this #P-hardness to the approximate case will require going outside the LFKN\/Lipton polynomial interpolation paradigm.”Œworkshop”Nub.€•É/;"	f

This event explores the astonishingly productive relationship between physics and mathematics and explores whether these disciplines might one day unify, perhaps leading to a giant structure that encompasses all the laws that describe the underlying workings of the universe.”Œworkshop”Nub.€•â/;"	p

While we prove that the resulting estimator for the covariance matrix is consistent in the classical limit as the number of projection images grow indefinitely, an interesting open question regarding the sample complexity of the problem remains. Namely, how many images are required in order to resolve heterogeneous structures as a function of the volume size and the signal to noise ratio? We will see that solving this question requires us to extend the analysis of principal component analysis (PCA) in high dimensions, as we encounter limiting distributions that differ from the classical Marcenko-Pastur distribution.$/;"	f

For a fixed n, how small must r be for the configuration space to be connected? How large can the Betti numbers be? I will discuss recent progress on this and related problems.”Œworkshop”Nub.€•g/;"	f

while	talks_ias.p	/^	Additionally, we show that, up to constant factors, our estimators are optimal, improving significantly upon the prior lower-bounds. The analysis of our matching lower bounds makes crucial use of two new multivariate central limit theorems that appear quite natural and general. The first is proven directly via Stein's method; the second is proven in terms of the first using a recent generalization of Newton's inequalities. The talk will include a high level overview of these techniques, and their application both in our context and more generally.”Œworkshop”Nub.€•Ò/;"	f

with	talks_ias.p	/^	We also study new models for PAC learning the class of DNF formulas. We consider a type of natural Boolean pairwise query that asks whether a pair of positive examples from a polynomial-sized sample satisfy at least one term in common in the target DNF, as well as numerical queries that ask how many terms in common the two examples satisfy. We begin with a somewhat surprising negative result: that learning general DNF formulas under arbitrary distributions from the above Boolean queries is as hard as PAC-learning DNF formulas without them. However, on the positive side we show general DNF can be learned from numerical queries over the uniform distribution, and give positive results for a number of other natural DNF classes. In the process, we give an algorithm for learning a sum of monotone terms from labeled data only.”Œworkshop”Nub.€•/;"	f
